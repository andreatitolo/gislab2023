## Laboratory structure

N.B. the structure may change, especially the practical section on Google Earth and QGIS, depending on what can be done in the classroom. A more detailed overview of the activities is available in the [[Laboratorio - Struttura dettagliata]].

## Timetables

Wednesday: 3-5 p.m
Thursday: 9-11 a.m

## Mode

The workshop will have an introductory part in the form of lectures on the history of landscape archaeology and its methodologies. Following this, most of the meetings will follow a mixed structure, with an introductory part at the beginning and a practical part in which we will see and work together on the aspects introduced at the beginning of the meeting. In the latter meetings, the practical aspect will be prevalent, depending of course on the subject matter. All the steps we will perform together during the practical meetings will however be shared in the slides in the `2. Slides` section.

## Objectives

The aim of the lectures is to provide an overview and theoretical basis on landscape archaeology, obviously with the limitations of the workshop compared to an actual course. For this reason, in section `5. Bibliography` a reference bibliography (**not compulsory**) will be shared in case you want to go deeper into the source of what was covered during the meetings.

The aim of the practical meetings is not to make you an expert in remote sensing, GIS or Google Earth, but to provide you with as detailed a theoretical, practical and documentary overview as possible in order to be able to use these tools independently and possibly go deeper if one or more of them interests you.

## Data and tools

The data used will, due to the nature of the laboratory, come from examples in West Asia (Iraq, Lebanon, Syria) and, with a few exceptions, will attempt to be data used on a daily basis and not prepared *ad-hoc*. In this way, we will use first-hand data that are used daily by various research projects, with all their advantages and problems of use. Indeed, it would be pointless to work with 'fake' data, which works perfectly well, without addressing the problems that exist in accessing and using data in West Asian archaeology.

For the same reason we will use QGIS, free and open-source software, which is available for free, and Google Earth, which is proprietary but nevertheless free. I firmly believe that it is wrong for students to approach the study of GIS using paid software such as ArcGIS, since it is not necessarily the case that everyone can afford the licence to use it.
